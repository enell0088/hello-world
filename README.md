# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. I am happily learning more about GitHub!
I am currently a Junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics and Information Systems at the Tippie College of Business. I've been passionate about pursuing business since Freshman year of high school, and I've included at least one business course in each of my semesters starting Junior year of high school. Since attending the University of Iowa, I have kept my career options open and completed many classes that divulged in the different majors Tippie has to offer. Additionally, I am an active member in the Women in Business club on campus where I have participated in many opportunities that have expanded my passion for business and built a strong community.

As for my choice in Marketing and BAIS, I've always been passionate about influencing people in a positive and interactive manner. Brainstorming and analyzing consumer behavior to not only better a business, but also the consumers they are serving serves a great purpose to me when pursuing a career. I am exploring and learning how to apply AI tools and software to market and data research.
