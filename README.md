# About Me
I am currently a Junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics and Information Systems at the Tippie College of Business. I've been passionate about pursuing business since Freshman year of high school, and I've included at least one business course in each of my semesters starting Junior year of high school. Since attending the University of Iowa, I have kept my career options open and completed many classes that divulged in the different majors Tippie has to offer, but I found my calling in Business Analytics and Marketing. I've always been passionate about influencing people in a positive and interactive manner. Brainstorming and analyzing consumer behavior to not only better a business, but also consumers preferences and choices serves a great purpose to me when pursuing a career. I am exploring and learning how to apply AI tools and software to market and data research and would love a career involving AI.
